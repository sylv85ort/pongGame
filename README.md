 Project made in Java to familiarize myself with the Swing graphics platform and the Java I learned in school. This project was made following an online course by Youtuber GamesWithGabe. The following course is linked below.

 I took the liberty to add a 2-player mode, where one character controls with W-S and the other with the Arrow Keys.

 I also implemented AI that gets harder and more precise with the more points you score. This works by setting a range for the AI to move, and allowing its speed and location to be more precise with the more points you score.

 First to 7 wins.

Controls:
Player 1
 Up - W
 Down - S

Player 2
 Up - Up arrow
 Down - Down arrow
